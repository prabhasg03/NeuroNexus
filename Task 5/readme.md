## TASK 5 - FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION
<p>Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in
images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar
cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally
add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese
networks or ArcFace</p>
